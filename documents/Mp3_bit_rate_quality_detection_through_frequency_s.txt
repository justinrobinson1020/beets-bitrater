ABSTRACT 
The  proliferation  of  the  lossy  MP3  format  as  the  standard  for  
audio transferred over the internet is of great concern to 
audiophiles,  those  who  deeply  care  about  good  audio  quality.  
Typically, the bit rate of an MP3 file is used as a relative measure 
of  audio  quality,  however,  this  check  fails  if  the  audio  has  been  
transcoded from a lower bit rate to a higher bit rate. In this paper, 
we  propose  a  method  of  detecting  the  original  lower  bit  rate  of a  
given  audio  file  by  analyzing  its high frequency spectrum. Using 
a  Support  Vector  Machine  classifier  and  five  classes  of  bit  rates  
(CBR  128  kbps, 192 kbps, 256 kbps, 320 kbps, and VBR-0), our 
algorithm  returned  an  average  success  rate  of  97%  in  correctly  
detecting  the  original  compressed  bit  rate  of  an  audio  file  in  the  
absence  of  any  coding  format  knowledge  other  than  the  audio  
signal itself. Furthermore, our algorithm also detected the original 
lower  bit  rates  of  320  kbps  MP3s  transcoded  from  128  kbps  and  
192 kbps sources with a success rate of 99%.

1.  INTRODUCTION Over  the  past  decade,  the  MPEG  Layer  III  (MP3)  compression  
standard  has  become  the  most  popular  means  of  transferring  and  
storing audio electronically. File sharing services such as 
BitTorrent,  and  devices  such  as  the  iPod  have  all  fueled  the  
demand  for  MP3  and  have  pushed  the  format  to  mainstream  
usage.  MP3  is  desirable  because  of  its  high  compression  rate;  a  
song  compressed  using  MP3  might  be  only  one  tenth  the  size  of  
the  original  CD-quality  recording.  To  achieve  compression  rates  
this  high,  one  cannot  rely  on  lossless  techniques  alone,  such  as  
Huffman  coding.  Instead,  some  part  of  the  information  from  the  
original audio must be discarded, which consequently makes MP3 
a  lossy  format.  Yet  the  information  is  discarded  intelligently  so  
that the final sound is still close enough to the original that casual 
listeners will not notice the compression. 
Under  the  MP3  standard,  an  audio  file  can  be  compressed  at  
different bit rates. Typically, the higher the bit rate, the better the 
audio will sound, since more bits are available to encode nuances 
present in the original signal. On the other hand, low bit rates may 
be  subject  to  compression  artifacts,  that  is,  audible  differences  
from  the  original  [7].  Audio  can  be  encoded  either  at  a  constant  
bit  rate  or  a  variable  bit  rate.  A  constant  bit  rate  of  128  kbps  is  
usually  the  lowest  acceptable  bit  rate  for  decent  music  quality,  
while  320  kbps  is  the highest that most MP3 encoders will allow 
and is generally regarded as excellent quality.  
The  driving  principle  behind  MP3  encoding  is  to  eliminate  parts  
of  the  audio  which  are  deemed  to  be  imperceptible  to  human  
hearing. There are many techniques to do this [5], but the one we 
will focus on is the elimination of high frequencies present in the 
audio.  CD-quality  music  is  encoded  at  a  sampling  frequency  of  
44.1 kHz, which according to Nyquist criteria, encapsulates signal 
frequencies up to 22.05 kHz. However, the human auditory 
system can only hear frequencies up to a maximum of 18-20 kHz, 
and this threshold typically degrades over the years for an 
individual. As a result of this natural observation and as a way to 
decrease  the  bit  rate  without  sacrificing  perceptive  quality,  MP3  
encoders  eliminate  varying  amounts  of  information  contained  in  
frequencies greater than 16 kHz. 
Based  on  the  examination  of  a  few  randomly  selected  songs,  we  
observe  that  the  amount  of  information  removed  from  the  high  
frequency range (16 kHz – 22 kHz) of music provides a clue as to 
the  encoded  bit  rate  of  the  audio,  without  any  other  information  
available,  such  as  compression  format  or  file  size.  Evidence  of  
this  can  be  seen  in  the  power  spectral  density  plots  of  Figures  1  
and  2.  In  Figure  1,  high  frequencies  above  16  kHz  are  entirely  
nonexistent  in  the  128  kbps  plot,  but  gradually  appear  as  the  bit  
rate is increased towards 320 kbps. The song used in this 
example,  Metallica’s  “Master  of  Puppets,”  is  a  fast  paced  hard  
rock  song.  However  even  for  slower,  softer  music  such  as  Sarah  
McLachlan’s  “Building  a  Mystery”  in  Figure  2,  the  frequency  
characteristics  over  the  different  bit  rates  exhibit  the  same  trend.

This  suggests  that  this  type  of  frequency  analysis  is  applicable  
over a wide range of genres of popular music. 
In addition, even after the song has been manipulated, and 
perhaps transcoded into a higher bit rate than the original, the loss 
of high frequency characteristics remains. An example of this can 
be  seen  in  Figure  3.  A  128  kbps  audio  clip  and  a  192  kbps  clip  
were  both  transcoded  to  a  higher  bit  rate,  320  kbps.  These  320  
kbps  audio  clips  will  logically  not  sound  any  better  than  their  
source, so judging sound quality purely by looking at that bit rate 
is  misleading.  Deeper  analysis  must  be  done.  We  found  that  the  
high frequency characteristics of these seemingly “excellent 
quality” songs were still highly correlated with the characteristics 
of  the  original  source;  in  fact,  they  were  nearly  identical.  In  
Figure  3,  the  320  kbps  MP3  transcoded  from  a  128  kbps  MP3  
matched  the  spectrum  seen  in  the  native  128  kbps  MP3  found  in  
Figure  1,  and  likewise  for  the  192  kbps  sourced  transcode.  Thus,  
by carefully observing this high frequency range, the true quality 
level based on original encoded bit rate can be determined, 
regardless of the bit rate claimed by the file itself. 
Numerous papers have been published in the field of audio 
forensics, with applications such as audio manipulation 
authentication  [6],  steganography  and  steganalysis  [4,  9],  and  
watermarking [3]. Likewise, there has been previous investigation 
into  the  authenticity  of  digital  compact  disc  recordings  using  the  
Aucdtect (CD authenticity detector) algorithm [8]. This algorithm 
is similar to our proposed method in that it uses a learned 
classifier based on frequency characteristics of a recording. 
However,  the  program  created  to  utilize  the  algorithm  will  only  
function on CD audio streamed directly from the CD, not already 
compressed  MP3  audio  which  has  been  ripped  onto  a  personal  
computer or downloaded from an unknown source on the internet. 
In addition, since the algorithm only searches for MPEG artifacts 
in  general,  it  can  only  discriminate  the  audio  between  full  CD  
quality and lossy MPEG quality. No indication is made about the 
relative  sound  quality  of  the  audio  if  it  does  happen  to  be  in  a  
lossy format. The objective of our algorithm, on the other hand, is 

to  investigate  how  MP3  audio  at  multiple  bit  rates  affects  the  
frequency spectrum, and if those characteristics alone can be used 
to  reverse  detect  the  bit  rate  and  thus  evaluate  relative  sound  
quality. 
One  important  benefit  of  such  analysis  is  to  verify  the  claimed  
quality  of  audio  obtained  from  an  unknown  source,  such  as  the  
internet. Music can easily be ripped from CD, streamed, 
downloaded, and transferred among peers; all though free 
mainstream  software  available  to  anyone.  It  is  quite  common  to  
encounter  an  MP3  file  which  has  been  transcoded  into  a  bit  rate  
higher  than  its  original  compressed  bit  rate.  This  may  happen  
maliciously (by anti-piracy organizations trying to discourage file

sharing,  for  example),  or  accidentally  (such  as  by  audio  novices  
who  are  unfamiliar  with  the  consequences  of  transcoding).  To  
anyone  who  subsequently  makes  a  copy  of  such  an  MP3  file,  
there is no evidence that transcoding occurred, other than the fact 
that  the  audible  quality  of  the  song  may  sound  poorer  than  the  
quality  typically  expected  by  MP3s  of  the  same  bit  rate  which  
were directly compressed to that bit rate from its original lossless 
source.  However,  without  reliable  hearing  and  the  true  high  bit  
rate  version  to  compare  to,  proof  of  transcoding  may  be  difficult  
just by ear. Instead, an automatic mathematical method  of  
analyzing  a  suspected  MP3  file  to  detect  a  low  quality  song  
disguised  as  a  high  bit  rate  song  would  be  more  reliable.  In  
addition,  by  being  able  to  verify  the  quality  of  an  MP3  from  an  
unknown  or  suspicious  source,  an  assessment  can  be  made  about  
the validity of the source.  
An  audiophile  is  an  individual  who  loves  music,  and  there  is  no  
better way to listen to music than at the highest quality possible. It 
is of great concern therefore, when an MP3 has been 
misrepresented  as  high  quality  audio  when  in  fact  it  has  been  
transcoded  from  a  lower  quality  file.  If  such  deception  could  be  
detected automatically, that algorithm would be of immense 
forensic benefit to audiophiles and those who place great 
importance on listening to guaranteed high quality music. 
Our  general  algorithm  is  as  follows.  First,  each  song  used  in  our  
analysis was converted from full CD quality to a variety of lower 
bit rates with MP3 compression. The frequency spectrum of each 
MP3  was  then  analyzed,  condensed,  and  converted  into  a  feature  
set  for  each  bit  rate  of  each  song  in  the  test  set.  These  features  
were used as inputs to a Support Vector Machine classifier which 
picked out the most useful features and used them to differentiate 
between MP3s of different bit rates with a good deal of success. 
2.  PROCEDURE 
2.1  Data Set Collection A total of 2512 different songs were used for analysis, 
representing some 94 different artists including such popular acts 
as  Metallica,  Oasis,  Nirvana,  In  Flames,  Journey,  U2,  Pearl  Jam,  
and  Radiohead.  These  songs  were  all  sourced  from  CD-quality  
audio  and  then  compressed  using  the  LAME  v3.97  MP3  encoder  
[1],  by  far  the  most  popular  and  reliable  MP3  encoder  currently  
available. Each song was compressed into five different bit rates: 
four  constant  bit  rates  of  128  kbps,  192  kbps,  256  kbps,  and  320  
kbps,  as  well  as  one  variable  bit  rate  of  VBR  quality  level  0  
(highest). Variable bit rate encoding adjusts the bit rate 
temporally within each song depending on the level of 
compression  needed  at  any  particular  moment.  VBR-0  is  the  
highest level of VBR encoding and corresponds to bit rates 
ranging from 224-300 kbps on average. 
2.2  Feature Extraction The five bit rates were then used as separate classes in a Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. SVM is a learning based 
classifier which finds the hyperplanes in a multidimensional space 
which best separate the features of each of the different classes. In 
order  to  find  the  correct  demarcation  between  each  of  the  given  
number  of  classes,  the  classifier  must  be  trained  with  a  subset  of  
the original data and information about which classes the 
elements  in  those  sets  belong  to.  Transformation  of  the  data  is  
often useful in order to better separate the class data. The process 
to  do  this  is  through  the  use  of  a  kernel  function,  which  remaps  
data  points  into  a  feature  space  where  the  hyperplane  divisions  
can be more easily defined.

128, 192, 256, and 320 kbps. The plots correspond to a rough 
depiction of the song’s frequency spectrum from 16-20 kHz at 
various bit rates.

In order to obtain the feature data, the source MP3 files were each 
decompressed  into  a  1411  kbps  WAV  file  using  the  Fraunhofer  
IIS  MP3  Surround  Commandline  Decoder  V1.4  [2].  This  was  
done  because  audio  files  in  this  format  can  easily  be  read  into  
MATLAB, and as we have demonstrated, transcoding to a higher 
bit  rate  does  not  affect  the  frequency  characteristics  of  the  audio  
which we are observing. Furthermore, since this bit rate 
corresponds  to  the  bit  rate  of  full  CD-quality  audio,  it  is  thus  the  
highest  ‘common  ground’  format  by  which  all  further  spectral  
analysis  tests  can  be  conducted  for  all  compressed  bit  rates.  
MATLAB was used to calculate the actual power spectral density 
for the entire time domain of each song. 
Since every data point in this frequency spectrum would be much 
too  large  to  realistically  consider  as  features,  the  dimensionality  
must be reduced. To do this, only the frequency range of 16 kHz 
–  20  kHz  is  considered,  since  this  is  suspected  to  be  the  only  
region  where  noticeable  differences  exist  between  the  classes  of  
bit  rates.  In  addition,  this  range  was  then  subdivided  into  100  
bands  of  approximately  43  Hz  each,  and  the  average  power  
spectral density for each of these bands was calculated. These 100 
values  were  used  as  the  feature  set  of  each  song.  Figure  4  shows  
the  plot  of  these  features  for  one  song,  while  Figure  5  shows  the  
plot of these features for all 2512 songs overlaid. While there are 
distinct differences in the shape of the curve for each bit rate, it is 
the job of the classifier to determine the correct separation 
between each class based on the feature set, and then to use those 
separations to classify a random unknown selection of songs. 
2.3  Classifier Parameters Support Vector Machines employ the use of a kernel function. In 
order  to  perform  a  better  classification  in  the  case  when  the  
relationship  between  the  data  and  the  classes  is  not  linear,  data  
samples can be remapped using various nonlinear kernel mapping 
functions [10]. Here we use the polynomial kernel, given by: 
( , ) ( ) T d 
i j i j K x x x x C    
Parameter values of d=2, γ=1, and C=1 were used. This classifier 
was trained using features from 500 randomly selected songs, and 
then tested on the remaining 2012 songs. This procedure was then 
repeated five times, each time using a different set of 500 random 
songs  for  learning  with  the  corresponding  2012  remaining  songs  
for test. The results of these five iterations were averaged. 
3.  RESULTS 
3.1  Bit Rate Differentiation After  the  classifier  was  trained  with  the  appropriate  randomly  
selected training data and tested on the remaining set of songs, the 
confusion matrix was calculated. The resulting average confusion 
matrix  for  five  iterations  is  shown  in  Table  1.  The  data  bit  rates  
above the five right-most vertical columns represent the 
corresponding bit rates as detected by the classifier, while the data 
bit rates to the left of each horizontal row represent the actual bit 
rates. 
It is clear that the classifier was highly successful at 
differentiating  between  bit  rates  based  solely  on  the  frequency  
spectrum  of  each  song.  The  average  classification  success  rate  is  
97% on a test set of 2012 songs.  
The  most  difficult  class  to  classify  was  the  middle  class,  256  
kbps,  with  a  success  rate  of  only  92.4%.  By  examining  the  
confusion matrix, 6.3% of the songs which were constant bit rate 
256 kbps MP3s were instead classified as variable bit rate quality 
level  0,  while  4.8%  of  VBR-0  MP3s  were  erroneously  classified  
as  256  kbps.  Undoubtedly,  this  is  due  to  the  fact  that  since  VBR  
inherently  has  variation  in  its  bit  rate,  this  naturally  leads  to  it  
being  mistaken  for  a  constant  bit  rate  at  a  similar  level,  and  vice  
versa. The distinction here is not as clear cut as it is for the other 
classes. For example, 128 kbps MP3 files were very distinctive in 
that nearly all had no frequencies higher than 16 kHz whatsoever. 
On the other extreme, 320 kbps MP3s were distinctive in that they 
nearly  always  had  frequency  components  up  to  20  kHz.  This  led  
to excellent results for the classification of these bit rates. 
3.2  Transcoding Detection Given  the  success  of  this  first  (and  most  important)  step,  the  
classifier  can  next  be  extended  towards  the  problem  of  detecting  
transcoded MP3s. No mechanisms exist in MP3 encoding utilities 
to prevent a person from taking a relatively low quality MP3 file, 
say,  128  kbps,  and  then  re-encoding  it  to  a  higher  bit  rate,  say,  
320  kbps.  This  up-coding  really  serves  no  purpose,  since  MP3  
compression is lossy. Once high frequency information about the 
original audio file has been discarded to compress it down to 128 
kbps,  that  information  cannot  be  recovered  (except  perhaps  with  
the use of experimental frequency enhancement algorithms [11]). 
Re-encoding  to  a  higher  bit  rate  will  simply  use  the  extra  bits  to  
encode the low bit rate signal more fully; in other words, the extra 
bits  become  redundant.  The  consequence  of  this  is  that  it  is  
impossible  to  recover  the  high  frequency  components  lost  in  the  
original compression. A spectrum analysis of a 320 kbps MP3 file 
which  has  been  transcoded  from  a  128  kbps  MP3  file  will  look  
nearly identical to the original 128 kbps MP3 itself (see Figure 3).

To verify this, the sets of 2512 128 kbps MP3 files and 2512 192 
kbps  MP3  files  were  both  transcoded  to  320  kbps.  The  true  320  
kbps  MP3  files  were  used  as  a  third  class  for  comparison.  These  
three  classes  were  used  as  test  input  to  the  trained  SVM  classifier  
utilized  previously.  The  resulting  confusion  matrix  is  shown  in  
Table 2. Again, the data bit rates above the five right-most vertical 
columns represent the classified, or, detected bit rates, while the data 
bit  rates  to  the  left  of  each  horizontal  row  represent  the  actual  bit  
rates: 128 kbps transcoded to 320 kbps, 192 kbps transcoded to 320 
kbps, and true 320 kbps. 
It is clear from this confusion matrix that the same classifier used to 
differentiate  between  different  MP3  quality  levels  can  likewise  be  
used  to  detect  transcoded  MP3s.  99.3%  of  the  128  kbps  MP3s  
converted  to  320  kbps  before  analysis  were  correctly  identified  as  
being  sourced  from  128  kbps,  while  99.4%  of  the  192  kbps  MP3s  
converted  to  320  kbps  before  analysis  were  correctly  identified  as  
being  sourced  from  192  kbps.  These  classification  rates  are  very  
similar to the classification rates of the true 128 kbps and 192 kbps 
MP3 files, undoubtedly because the spectral properties of the 
transcoded signal does not change much from the original bit rate. 
4.  CONCLUSION In the age of the internet where files such as MP3s can effortlessly 
be  transferred  between  individuals,  verification  of  the  quality  of  
these  files  can  become  quite  difficult  to  detect.  Since  transcoding  
from a low bit rate to a high bit rate is not restricted, MP3 songs of 
this  type  will  undoubtedly  arise,  either  by  malicious  users  with  the  
intent  to  deceive,  or  by  individuals  who  simply  do  not  know  what  
they  are  doing  and  do  not  understand  the  consequence  of  their  
actions.  Occasionally,  the  transcoding  can  be  detected  audibly  by  
listening to a song, however, due to imperfections in human hearing 
and  individuals  with  untrained  ears,  detection  this  way  can  be  
difficult,  especially  when  trying  to  differentiate  between  bit  rates  
that  are  already  high,  for  example,  between  a  256  kbps  and  a  320  
kbps  MP3  file.  Both  of  these  compression  levels  are  audibly  close  
enough to CD-quality that most listeners cannot tell the difference in 
a controlled, double blind listening test. 
Given these difficulties, the ability to reverse detect the original bit 
rate  from  a  decompressed  audio  file  is  incredibly  useful.  From  a  
forensics  standpoint,  this  provides  the  ability  to  glimpse  into  the  
“history” of an encoded audio file and verify if the claimed bit rate 
is valid. If the detected bit rate is less than the claimed bit rate, then 
this  is  good  evidence  that  the  audio  has  been  transcoded,  and  thus,  
that  the  original  encoded  audio  file  has  been  tampered  with.  Such  
evidence  of  digital  tampering  may  come  in  handy  in  criminal  
investigations  where  the  authenticity  of  a  recording  is  of  utmost  
importance. Similarly, high frequency analysis and the changes that 
occur therein at different compression levels may have applications 
in areas such as audio steganalysis. Finally, transcoding detection is 
beneficial  to  those who simply want to be reassured that the music 
they  download,  copy,  and  listen  to  is  not  of  a  deceivingly  lower  
quality than they expect. 
Our results show that such original bit rate detection is very possible 
when  one  considers  the  high  frequency  spectrum  of  the  audio  in  
question, and compares it with known spectrum patterns for various 
bit rates. An average of 1945 out of 2012 songs tested (97%) were 
correctly  classified  intro  their  original  bit  rates  using  the  proposed  
method.  Likewise,  an  average  of  99.4%  of  songs  transcoded  from  
128  kbps  and  192  kbps  to  320  kbps  were  correctly  identified  as  
being sourced from the lower original bit rate. 
The  high  frequency  spectrum  is  thus  a reliable way of determining 
the  true  bit  rate  based  quality  of  an  MP3  song  across  a  range  of  
different songs, artists, and genres. In future work, we would like to 
explore  a  larger  set  of  songs  with  more  classes,  such  as  additional  
VBR quality levels. We would also like to test the reliability of this 
method  using  different  MP3  encoders,  as  well  as  different  audio  
compression algorithms such as AAC.
